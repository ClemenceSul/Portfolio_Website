                    <span>Our earth is suffering from mankind’s actions, the rise of temperature  causing drastic damage in the arctic and antarctic, with ice melting generating a chain of problems. Furthermore, the race for unexploited ressources in these territories exhasterbates the banishment of the arctic and antarctic animals. This is what I wished to expose with my automaton, a factory taking over the land from the animals, whom will only appear in old videos if we continue on this destructive path.</span>

                    <span>Actors are a crutial element when narrating a compelling story. In the factory line, all workers were made identical, with very few details, so the sense of seperate individuals disappears and they become a uniform robot-like group drilling into the ice. In comparison, the animals were given a low poly aesthetic granting them a ghost like appearance as phantoms of a past reality.</span>

                    <span class="paragraph_title">Various cams for precise actor movements.</span>
                    <span>To mimick reality, the cams were designed according to the movements required for each actor. Each worker in the factory line must go up and down to represent drilling. In addition, the cams were designed with a sudden drop to create a constant ticking noise like a machine would. For the penguins, an oscillating motion was prefered, to resemble their walk (top middle). The polar bear and seal used uneven cams for a story-like result of the polar bear reaching for the seal. In the polar bear, the weight of the arm pulled the link up, hence an inversed slider was designed (bottom right).</span>

                    <span>Although each part of the automaton can designed seperately, all the gears and shafts used the same male / female shapes which made them interchangeable (top left). This was quite useful to test mechanisms with pre-printed pieces and solved multiple issues encountered when assembling. As this project stipulated only 3D printed pieces were allowed, blocks (top right) were designed to avoid unwanted movements of the pieces and some pieces were melted (bottom right) to permenantly attach them.</span>

                    <span>After assembling the working automaton together, I realized some shapes were hard to distinguish from one another as they had all been printed with the same filament. Hence, the actors of the scene were painted to make them stand out from the rest of the automaton.</span>

                    <span>When actioned, the automaton generates an interesting clicking noise from the factory line cams and other connections, however I wished to discretely enhance certain movements of the actors in the video. Therefore various sound effects were imagined, recorded and implemented.</span>
